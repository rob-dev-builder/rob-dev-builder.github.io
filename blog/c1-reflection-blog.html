      <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
        <p>So far I think the EDA experience is very unique. It seems like a very bold way to teach web development. It is very diffeent from other web developer courses I have heard about.<p>

      <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
        <p>I am really impressed so far. I really like the idea that the cohort is encrouaged to help each other and learn from each other as much as possible. I also feel a little bit overwhelmed sometimes when I think about the end goal of becoming a web developer. However, I think the prep work and help from fellow students helps to ease that anxiety.<p>

      <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
        <p>I really want to contribute to making the learning experience as fun and interesting as possioble. I think that is the best way to engage with the EDA culture.<p>

      <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
        <p> I did a lot of research before signing up to EDA. So, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect before I joined - and I like it!<p>

      <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
        <p>Yes! and yes I'm nervious and that makes me more excited!<p>
