<h3>Time and Habits</h3>
<h4>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
  <p>I have been trying the Pomodora and the 'getting in the zone techniques'</p>
<h4>what did you find interesting?</h4>
  <p>The Pomodoro is interesting because its quite a practical way to keep yourself motivated. I find it a really good way to keep focueed on tasks and if I feel like a break I just have to tell my self its only 20 minutes away!</p>
<h4>what worked for you?</h4>
  <p>The Pomodoro is working well for me. </p>
<h4>which will you experiment further with?</h4>
  <p>I will experiment with the 'tiny habits' (frogg method) technique.</p>
