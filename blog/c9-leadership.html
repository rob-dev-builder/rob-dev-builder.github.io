        <h4>Question heading</h4>
         <p>Blog Text</p> -->
         <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
         <p>
           I have had managers who have been compassionate and not so compassionate. I can relate to the idea that you feel more motivated to work for leaders who are compassionate to their team members. I remember feeling very motivated when I worked for a manager who made an effort to understand the team members and expressed a genuine desire to help the team.
         </p>
         <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
         <p>
           This was very calming and helped me focus. This also made me understand that everyone is essentially the same and wants to do good.</p>

         <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
         <p>
          I didn't find this particularly difficult. I think this technique helps to prepare you for dealing with difficult people who may be angry about something. If you can figuratively take in their anger and replace it with calmness then that would help to build better relationships.
        </p>
         <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
         <p>
           In terms of status, I guess I do feel a little threatened when I realise someone else in the cohort knows more than me. I will need to be aware of this going into bootcamp. The way I can deal with this (as described in the book) is to improve my skills and compare how I have improved against myself.<br>
           Not having certainty about full time work after bootcamp may play on my mind during bootcamp. I will need to be aware of this and try not to worry about that too much while I study.<br>
           Relating to the other members of my cohort will be very important to how much I enjoy bootcamp. I will make a big effort to get know my fellow cohort and hopefully become good friends.
         </p>
         <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>
         <p>
            This section reminded me of a difficult conversation I had a few years when I was asking for a pay raise. I related to the 'three conversations' mentioned in the book. When I was talking to my manager about the pay raise I was asking myself "Am I competent/good enough for this".
