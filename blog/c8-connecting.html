         <h3>Connecting</h3>

       <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
        <p>
          I have noticed with my friends that being vulneratble does help to build trust. Opening up with friends shows that you are willing to expose yourself and trust that your friend does not take advandage if your vunrebility. My friends tend to feel more relaxed when I am open with them. This in turn allows them to be free to open up and become vunreable (if they wish too). I can see how becoming vunreable to friends can create great trust.
        </p>
       <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
          <p>I haven't had a chance to try a formal empathic listening session with anyone yet. But, I will try it informally with my friends later this week. I like the idea of starting a response with "This is what I hear" to confirm that I have understood what they have said.</p>

       <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
          <p>I found this relaxing and it also gave me a better perspective on the other persons point of view. Sometimes it can be hard to remove yourself from a heated discussion. However, this technique is useful in pulling your self away from an argument and remembering that the other person has valid ideas and experiences too.</p>

       <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>
          <p>1.Workmate that makes a lot of noise when typing on keyboard.</P>
            <br>
          <p>2. (My perspective) My workmate had an annoying habit of banging down on his keyboard. This was very distracting as I would not be able to concentrate whenever he was typing. When I suggested to him that he could get different keyboard (I even offered to buy a new one) he refused! I was really annoyed because I felt like I could get more work done if only he changed his keyboard.</p>
          <br>
          <p>3. (Workmate perspective) My workmate recently told me that I am too noising when I type on my keyboard. I am shocked because I didn't realise something like that would bother him. I really like my keyboard and don't want to change it. I shouldn't have to change my keyboard because someone else thinks its annoying. My keyboard is comfortable and I'm use to it. I can get more work done using this keyboard.</p>
